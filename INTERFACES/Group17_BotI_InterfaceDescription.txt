Interfaces â€“ Group 17 (Bot I)

As the Bot I subsystem, we communicate with Game Manager by receiving the current board state when it's the bot's turn. 
We analyze the board and return a valid move for the bot's piece. We guarantee all moves follow game rules.

Our interfaces include:

1. generateMove(boardState) -> move
   - Takes the current 8x8 board state (X = human, O = bot, V = valid, ! = invalid)
   - Returns a legal move in the format: {from: [x1, y1], to: [x2, y2]}
   - Uses simple rules to decide moves (always follows game rules)
   - Responds within 10 seconds

2. validateMove(boardState, move) -> boolean
   - (Optional) Checks if a potential move is legal
   - Uses same rules as the Game Play subsystem for consistency

Note:
- We only make legal moves (never break rules)
- Our bot is simple but follows all game requirements
- We work with Game Manager to take turns properly
- Move format matches what Game Play expects

Dependencies:
- Needs current board state from Game Manager
- May use Game Play's rules to validate moves
