Description:
Pair Up is responsible for determining how to pair up two players for a game of chess. Once an active player chooses to join a lobby in Join Game, Pair Up will record who they would like to play against (another human, bot I, bot II) and send that information to Game Manager to start a game whenever both parties of that lobby mutually agree to play one another. On top of the standard connection timeout errors, Pair Up will also be in charge of troubleshooting any matchmaking errors such as 3 players attempting to play in 1 lobby, as well as improving efficiency by offering the option to play with another human/bot if there was an evident issue with their first choice. 
The methods that are currently being implemented are (createLobby(playerId)) that creates an empty lobby with one human player occupying the first slot and (RefreshLobbies()) to retrieve a list of current open lobbies.
